# A Star

A Star Algorithm is a popular and powerful search algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal, particularly in situations where you need to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal. It combines features of both Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, making it efficient and widely applicable.
